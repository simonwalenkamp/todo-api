## What did i do before getting started?
- ChatGPT, Reddit, Google
- Thinking about the approach 🚿🚲🏋️‍♀️
- Why not use Play Framework or ZIO?

## The Code
- http4s & cats
- in memory data storage. 🙈
- single test that calls all endpoints (mostly vibe coded) 🤖

## What should be next
- Error handling and response types
- More tests! Especially for the service...
- We need a real DB (PostgreSQL: open-sources, ecosystem, previous experience)
- Create Users
- Auth
- Logging
- Monitoring & Alerts (Prometheus & Grafana)
- Docker
- CI/CD
- Frontend
- Docker Compose
